It is thus very challenging to delineate the structure-property relationship. We aim at developing synthetic strategy to create molecularly well defined interfaces and constructing advanced characterization techniques with high spatial/temporal resolution and/or operando capability to discover catalytic mechanism.",
                "2. The heterogeneous active sites in traditional solid catalysts lead to poor selectivity in catalysis, which finally yields wasteful by-product and many cases of pollution in chemical industry. We aim at creating better defined active sites to enhance selectivity that paves the way for greener chemical industry.",
